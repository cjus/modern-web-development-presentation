  > Today we have specialized text editors which understand JavaScript syntax and provide a host of features for
  working with web content. Most modern editors support plugins which can help spot common errors. If you're using a
  lame
  editor you may be missing out! More about this later.

  > Raw files deployed to webserver without packaging: This isn't something you have to do, but for larger projects it
  can
  make a really big difference by reducing site load times.

  > Monolithic source files with no real code organization: Today's tools support code organization and help to create
  maintainable web applications.

  > No use of: Backbone, Ember, Knockout, React or Angular:
  > Following our last point on code organization, there are lots of libraries and frameworks which help structure web
  projects. For non-trivial projects you really should be using one of them. Which one you **should use** can be a
  subject
  of some heated debate.

  > Source control systems are like intelligent backups for code. Modern web devs use source control systems such as
  Git, even when working on a single personal project on their local machines.

  > Working on a project often requires a number of tasks which can be executed manually or automated. Modern web dev
  favors automation.

  > No use of code linters, style checkers, or beautifiers: Code quality matters! Don't leave this to chance or good
  will. Modern web devs use each of these tools, in best cases these tools run as part of background automation.

  > Little or no testing: Modern web devs ensure their code includes tests. Remember, code is only theoretically
  complete without tests. By "complete" I mean complete relative to established requirements and requirements are the
  thing your tests confirm.

  > As a precusor to the rest of our talk: Modern web devs accomplish more using tool automation and libraries and
  framework. It's about applying leverage. Working smarter and not harder.

> Testing is traditionally an area where less is done than might be necessary.

> Modern devs know that they can write unit test to test logical portions of their code and they can write integration tests to test modules working together and functional tests to test features.

> All of this is great!  What could be better right?

> Well, it does get better - when all of this is gets automated.

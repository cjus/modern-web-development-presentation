    > Before we begin, by a show of hands, how many people have used the following:

    > How many of you are using Bootstrap or Foundation?

    > A build tool such as Grunt or Gulp?

    > A text editor such as Sublime, Brackets or Atom?

    > How about an IDE such as Webstorm, Eclipse or Aptana?

    > How many of you use a source control system such as Subversion, Git or Github?

    > How about a library such as Backbone, Ember, Knockout or React?

    > How about a framework such as AngularJS?

    > Ok, how many of us have done unit testing using Jasmine, qUnit or Mocha?

    > Any CoffeeScripters in the house?

    > Anyone use ES6 features today?

    > Hmmm ok, interesting. If you're not familar with any of terms I've just referenced we'll go over them in this presentation

    > And I may not cover your favorite tool.

    > The goal of this presentation is to discuss web development and to consider what modern web devs are doing these days.

    > You may find some of it useful in your own projects.

    > In the spirit of modern web development this presentation is built entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and works on your modern web browser and mobile devices.

    <ul>
      <li>Sites built using a generic text editor</li>

      > Today we have specialized text editors which understand JavaScript syntax and provide a host of features for working with web content. Most modern editors support plugins which can help spot common errors. If you're using a lame editor you may be missing out! More about this later.

      > Raw files deployed to webserver without packaging: This isn't something you have to do, but for larger projects it can make a really big difference by reducing site load times.

      > Monolithic source files with no real code organization: Today's tools support code organization and help to create maintainable web applications.

      > No use of: Backbone, Ember, Knockout, React or Angular:
      > Following our last point on code organization, there are lots of libraries and frameworks which help structure web projects. For non-trivial projects you really should be using one of them. Which one you **should use** can be a subject of some heated debate.

    <ul>
      <li>No use of source control</li>
      <li>Manual and repetitive processes to work with site files before and during deployment</li>
      <li>No use of code linters, style checkers, or beautifiers</li>

      > Source control systems are like intelligent backups for code.  Modern web devs use source control systems such as Git, even when working on a single personal project on their local machines.

      > Working on a project often requires a number of tasks which can be executed manually or automated. Modern web dev favors automation.

      > No use of code linters, style checkers, or beautifiers: Code quality matters! Don't leave this to chance or good will. Modern web devs use each of these tools, in best cases these tools run as part of background automation.

      > Little or no testing: Modern web devs ensure their code includes tests. Remember, code is only theoretically complete without tests. By "complete" I mean complete relative to established requirements and requirements are the thing your tests confirm.

      > As a precusor to the rest of our talk: Modern web devs accomplish more using tool automation and libraries and framework.  It's about applying leverage. Working smarter and not harder.

  </section>

  <!-- How can modern practices help? -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
    <h3>How can modern practices help?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve code quality: try jshint, js-beautify, jscs</li>
      <li>Optimize for production use: use concatination and minification</li>
      <li>Need large projects scale in terms of developers: use a JS library or framework (ex: Backbone, React, or Angular)</li>
      <li>Testing tools</li>
      <li>Automation, automation, automation</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
      ---
      > One area that makes a huge difference is in code quality. The more error prone your code, the less likely it will meet customer needs.

      > Modern devs understand that through code reviews are time consuming and policing code is a thankless job. You just end up pissing off your fellow devs.

      > That's why successful devs use tools like jshint or jslint (to spot errors and questional practices).

      > They also use tools like js-beautify to fix code that's not properly formated and JSCS (The Javascript code style checker) to ensure that code maintains an agreed upon look and feel.

      > Improving site performance can lead to a competive advantage as customers prefer your site instead of your competitors.

      > In a study, Amazon determined that a page load slowdown of just one second could cost them $1.6 billion in sales per year.

      > Google determined that if its search results were four tenths of a second slower they could lose 8 million searches per day.  The result of which would be millions fewer online ads.

      > Performance matters.

      > Optimizing a web application for production use involves intelligently packaging site files so that they take up less space and load faster.  This process involves tools called minifiers which translate file contents into smaller version by renaming code variable and doing things like removing white space characters.

      > Minifiers exists for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

      > There are also image minifiers which change the compression ratio on images to reduce their size without impacting quality in a noticiable manner.

      > If you're not using one of them, check them out!

      > Now as a project increase in size, more devs end up touching the code. Worse though is that not all of the devs end up sticking around.

      > So quite often the original developers are long gone. This is why choosing a well-known library or framework (which you didn't invent) can help add structure to your projects.

      > JS frameworks help with a concerpt called "Seperation of concerns" by introducing other concepts such as Models, Views, Controllers, Service, Routers and other good stuff.</li>

      > A key benifit is that they help add structure and help improve maintainability</li>

      > So if you chose to use say Angular, you could hire or train developers to write code consistently with the rest of the project.  New team members then simply need to learn where files are stored and how the project is assembled in order to get up to speed.

      > Best of all they can use books and online training materials to get up to speed. Again, because you didn't invent the framework there's a greater chance that you'll find a helping hand when you need it.

      > Testing is traditionally an area where less is done than might be necessary.

      > Modern devs know that they can write unit test to test logical portions of their code and they can write integration tests to test modules working together and functional tests to test features.

      > All of this is great!  What could be better right?

      > Well, it does get better - when all of this is gets automated.

    <h3>Bringing it all together</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use JS friendly build tools such as Grunt and Gulp</li>
      <li>Both are build systems which include a massive collection of plugins for doing just about anything you need to in the life time of your project.</li>
      <li>They can help you do everything we've already discussed and things like pushing your code to cloud services such as Amazon and Heroku and your assets to content delivery networks.</li>

      ---
      > So everything that we've discussed so far fits neatly under the unbrella of a build system such as Grunt or Gulp.

      > They each feature a massive library of plugins for things like automtically checking your JavaScript for correctness, running tests scripts, packaging your projects and deploying them to the the cloud and much much more.

      > If you're not using these tools now, they should be in your future - set aside some time to get to know them.

    > Before we begin, by a show of hands, how many people have used the following:

    > How many of you are using Bootstrap or Foundation?

    > A build tool such as Grunt or Gulp?

    > A text editor such as Sublime, Brackets or Atom?

    > How about an IDE such as Webstorm, Eclipse or Aptana?

    > How many of you use a source control system such as Subversion, Git or Github?

    > How about a library such as Backbone, Ember, Knockout or React?

    > How about a framework such as AngularJS?

    > Ok, how many of us have done unit testing using Jasmine, qUnit or Mocha?

    > Any CoffeeScripters in the house?

    > Anyone use ES6 features today?

    > Hmmm ok, interesting. If you're not familiar with any of terms I've just referenced we'll go over them in this presentation

      > During the past five years there has been an explosive growth of tools.

      > New tools are appearing at a dizzying rate.

      > If you follow this stuff you know what I mean. It's impossible to really keep up with it all.

      > Still, you need to keep an eye on new development and learn just enough to decide whether it's something you should care about.

      > The Web development community has really grown up.  Not only is it on par with native development, in someways it's leading.  There is an order of magnitude more going on in the Web and JavaScript community than in any other language or platform.

      > Great ways to stay on top of modern web dev is to embrace tools and best practices.  Also engage the community by attending meetups and conferences.

      > Don't forget the web is your friend. Checkout the great training sites available.

      > Sure some of them charge 20 bucks or more per month.  But seriously, it's a small price to invest in your career.

    <h3>Text editor vs. IDE</h3>

      <li>Any text editor will let you edit code</li>

      <li>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) complements its built-in text editor with a host of integrated tools</li>

      ---
      > Any text editor will let you edit your code.

      > However, a text editor designed for web development will let you do much more than just editing.

      > At the opposite end of web friendly text editors are IDEs, Integrated Development Environments.  These tools typically integrate tools which extend what you can do within a common environment.  For some, such as yours truely, this can be a nice advantage. For example, text editors don't typically allow you to debug your code from within the editor - instead you do this outside of the editor. Where as, some IDEs allow you to debug right inside the IDE.

      > It is worth noting that many of today's web dev text editors go beyond being basic text editors and also offer a fare amount of tool integration.

      > It's definitely not easy to decide which one is best for you. Most devs simply use what the cools kids are using... what ever that might be this week.

      > My tip for you is to compare the costs, and features and see which one best fits your needs. For me, webstorm offered the ability to debug node applications and that was and remains an important feature.

      > One area that makes a huge difference is in code quality. The more error prone your code, the less likely it will meet customer needs.

      > Modern devs understand that through code reviews are time consuming and policing code is a thankless job. You just end up pissing off your fellow devs.

      > That's why successful devs use tools like jshint or jslint (to spot errors and questionable practices).

      > They also use tools like js-beautify to fix code that's not properly formatted and JSCS (The Javascript code style checker) to ensure that code maintains an agreed upon look and feel.

      > The good news is that many editors, (especially the four we looked at) include support for these tools.

    <aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
      ---
      > There are dozens to choose from. They each provide ways of helping you structure and build web projects.

      > For non-trivial projects you really should be using one of them. Which one you **should use** can be a
      subject of some heated debate.

      > As a project increase in size, more devs end up touching the code. Worse though is that not all of the devs
      end up sticking around.

      > Quite often the original developers are long gone. This is why choosing a well-known library or framework
      (which you didn't invent) can help when it comes time to hire new developers.

      > So if you chose to use say Angular, you could hire or train developers to write code consistently with the rest
      of the project. New team members then simply need to learn where files are stored and how the project is assembled
      in order to get up to speed.

      > Best of all they can use books and online training materials to get up to speed. Again, because you didn't
      invent the framework there's a greater chance that you'll find a helping hand when you need it.

      > JS frameworks help with a concept called "Seperation of concerns" by introducing other concepts such as Models,
      Views, Controllers, Service, Routers and other good stuff.

      > A key benefit is that they help add structure and help improve maintainability

      > Another great benefit is that they provide you well tested and battle harden code which you didn't have to write yourself!

    <aside class="notes" data-markdown="">

      > Improving site performance can lead to a competitive advantage as customers prefer your site instead of your
      competitors.

      > In a study, Amazon determined that a page load slowdown of just one second could cost them $1.6 billion in sales
      per year.

      > Google determined that if its search results were four tenths of a second slower they could lose 8 million
      searches per day. The result of which would be millions fewer online ads.

      > Clearly, performance matters.

      > Optimizing a web application for production use involves intelligently packaging site files so that they take up
      less space and load faster. This process involves tools called minifiers which translate file contents into
      smaller version by renaming code variable and doing things like removing white space characters.

      > Minifiers exists for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

      > There are also image minifiers which change the compression ratio on images to reduce their size without
      impacting quality in a noticeable manner.
